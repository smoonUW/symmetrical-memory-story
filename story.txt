A mist of sea spray veils the rocky bluff overlooking a cold, turbulent sea.
Verdant green grass covers the top of the bluff and the expansive plane that lies inland.  A lone figure stands at the egde, facing the waves.  It is an automaton, a GE Mark III, (version 10 to be precise), its cold, grey metal shell blending in with the misty rocks of the cliffside.
