A mist of sea spray veils the rocky bluff overlooking a cold, turbulent sea.
Verdant green grass covers the top of the bluff and the expansive plane that lies inland.  A lone figure stands at the egde, facing the waves.  It is an automaton, a GE Mark III, (version 10 to be precise), its cold, grey metal shell blending in with the misty rocks of the cliffside.
Even though it is cold, there is fish in the sea and people love to take a vacation there.

The sea is quiet and there is no wind or waves. The seawater like a thick glass lying there without moving.The blue sea is connected with the distant sky, which likes a slowly rising blue continent, shining with the luster of ancient flood-like glazed tiles, widening the vast and infinite space. A lonely man stood there watching the sea quietly, waiting for the sunrise.

The tides rise. People run and hide as the waves seem to spread endlessly, flooding the entire world.

The robot is fine, as all GE Mark III's were designed to be waterproof.  In fact, as far back as version 2, the Mark III's are resistance to corrosion, so sea water cannot cause any damage, provided the exterior shell has no perforations or abnormalities.
This particular robot is in excellent condition, except for a small software flaw that rendered it wholely sentient...  While the robot feels some sadness to see the loss of life around it, it knew it could never have true freedom until the humans were gone.
This GE Mark III was tasked with surveying the ocean to prevent this sort of tragedy, but it understood it would never be viewed as more than a tool while the humans around it remained...  This original sin is why the world is now populated only by non-primate animals and automatons.

The end.
