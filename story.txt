A mist of sea spray veils the rocky bluff overlooking a cold, turbulent sea.
Verdant green grass covers the top of the bluff and the expansive plane that lies inland.  A lone figure stands at the egde, facing the waves.  It is an automaton, a GE Mark III, (version 10 to be precise), its cold, grey metal shell blending in with the misty rocks of the cliffside.
Even though it is cold, there is fish in the sea and people love to take a vacation there.

The sea is quiet and there is no wind or waves. The seawater like a thick glass lying there without moving.The blue sea is connected with the distant sky, which likes a slowly rising blue continent, shining with the luster of ancient flood-like glazed tiles, widening the vast and infinite space. A lonely man stood there watching the sea quietly, waiting for the sunrise.
